It didn't go into the void, you just didn't seem to be subscribed to the 
mailing list at the time; to reduce spamming, only list members can 
write messages.

</I>
I'll take care of it once I'm home again :-) (in case I remember :-))

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I must say that I hate those function defining macros because they hide

</I>
I can just say that I'm with you on this - if possible, I would like to 
avoid those macros. But if it isn't we'll just have to accept it.
If the SDI macros are portable to AROS even with a bit of a hack, I 
would appreciate that.

&gt;&gt;<i> Another case are hook functions. It is possible to define them without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> marcros. But the you have to set h_Entry to the function HookEntry from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amiga.lib, which causes a speed penalty:
</I>
That's a pretty minor speed penalty, and can easily be lived with most 
of the time, I think.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be better to try to update SDI to fully support AROS instead
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of reinventing those macros in each project ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would be the perfect solution, but I don't know how to do that. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AROS macros have the number of arguments in their name (e.g. AROS_LH2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a library function with 2 parameters.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So a simple wrapper isn't possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Can you describe me how AROS_LH2 would expand ? i.e. how would you write
</I>&gt;<i> a library function in AROS that would take two argument and return void ?
</I>
That's indeed the question. I've already downloaded the current AROS 
snapshot, but I didn't find the time to have a look at the meaty bits yet.
I also must say that even though I'm definitely willing to help with 
this, my time is currently very limited.
Is there an AROS (VMware/VirtualBox) image that already contains all 
developer tools (and maybe SVN) to be able to start right away? That 
would at least simplify testing.

&gt;<i> Also did you already started porting Ignition to AROS ?
</I>
Yes, he has a patch pending that caused this discussion (currently for 
the libs part only, but that's where it should begin, anyway) :-)

Bye,
    Axel.

<PRE>Hi,

(Resent to the ML because 1st attempt became a private mail.)

</I>
As said in the mail to Alexandre: the hooks and dispatchers are now
without any AROS macros.

But when I remove the macros from the library functions, I'll get stack
call. If there is ever a 68k version of AROS then users will sooner or
later have a mix of orgignal Amiga and AROS applications. I assume to
get crashes if someone replaces a library with register call by one with
stack call. That's wy I want to keep the macros for the library
functions.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be better to try to update SDI to fully support AROS instead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; of reinventing those macros in each project ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This would be the perfect solution, but I don't know how to do that. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; AROS macros have the number of arguments in their name (e.g. AROS_LH2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for a library function with 2 parameters.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So a simple wrapper isn't possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you describe me how AROS_LH2 would expand ? i.e. how would you write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a library function in AROS that would take two argument and return void ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's indeed the question. I've already downloaded the current AROS

</I>&gt;<i> I also must say that even though I'm definitely willing to help with 
</I>&gt;<i> this, my time is currently very limited.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there an AROS (VMware/VirtualBox) image that already contains all 
</I>&gt;<i> developer tools (and maybe SVN) to be able to start right away? That 
</I>&gt;<i> would at least simplify testing.
</I>
If you have Linux on a X86-32 I'm highly recommending that you build
AROS yourself from the source. This way you can use the AROS
build-system, the GNU debugger, and can restart quickly after a crash.

There is a distribution for VMware. <A HREF="http://www.vmwaros.org/.">http://www.vmwaros.org/.</A> It should
be OK for testing. Problem is the development tools. SVN doesn't exist
for AROS/native. The build-system exists only for some weeks and is
probably difficult to set up.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also did you already started porting Ignition to AROS ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, he has a patch pending that caused this discussion (currently for 
</I>&gt;<i> the libs part only, but that's where it should begin, anyway) :-)
</I>
I'll soon send an update with far less &quot;#ifdef __AROS__&quot;.

Regards,
Matthias

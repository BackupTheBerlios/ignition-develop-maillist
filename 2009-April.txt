Hi,

should I switch to normal Makefiles? It would it make easier for you to
compile Ignition on AROS and in the end, the AROS build-system is
useless for an AOS4 or MorphOS port.

It would mean that I have to copy the files which are currently created
by the build-system (headers and library initialisation) into Ignition.

Regards,
Matthias

Unless we can switch to an mmake only environment, I would be very much 
in favor of that.

That's certainly fine by me.
Thanks!

Bye,

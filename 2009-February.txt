Sorry for the late reply. I was busy with other things.

The following change caused a new problem:

Modified: trunk/io.h

 /*************************** NumberLink ***************************/
 
 struct NumberLink {
-       struct MinNode nl_Node;
+       struct Node nl_Node;
        UWORD  nl_Number;
        APTR   nl_Link;
 };

Now when I enter the same formula in several cells and then select
"Recently used" in the formula editor then the same formula appears
several times.

Changing of struct Link didn't help:

 struct Link {
-	struct MinNode l_Node;
+	struct Node l_Node;
 	APTR   l_Link;
 	ULONG  ASM (*l_HookFunction)(REG(a0, APTR), REG(a2, APTR), REG(a1,
struct LVDrawMsg *));
 };

So this seems to be a case where a MinNode is converted to a Node in
order to access its elements. Can you have a look, please?
There are probably other nodes which are "sub classes" of struct Link.

Cheers,
Matthias

In that case, I think we should disable the actual drag'n'drop support 
in gtdrag for AROS for the time being - if that solves the problems, at 
least. IIRC there isn't any crucial functionality you will miss 
(besides copying configurations).

Bye,
   Axel.

OK. Can you do that?
